I workd on applied Statistical and computational methods for analysis of genomic data including methods for quantifying and correcting for population structure, detecting selection across the genome, loci dependent methods for modeling identity by descent, associations in small historically isolated population and various topics for analysis of next generation sequencing including low pass sequencing and ancient DNA.
